  <h3>Hello, I'm Nancy!</h3> 
    <div><p> I'm from Santa Clarita, CA. I'm excited to be here at CSSI!
    I like reading, going to the beach, and exploring new places. 
    I will be attending <span>Scripps College</span> in the fall. It's a tiny and
      beautiful campus located in Claremont, CA. </p></div>

      Come visit my github page <a href= "https://github.com"> here!</a>

  <p id=p2> This is a new paragraph. I don't really know what to write. All I know
    is that I'm going to try to center it because I don't fully understand how
    center stuff.</p>
